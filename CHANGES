v0.1.1: This minor release builds the library with -fPIC enabled.

v0.1: First release.  Provides a complete, albeit spartan, runtime
      and standard library for Smudge.  Implements all "SMUDGE_*"
      functions, and exposes an interface to control the runtime,
      including starting, stopping, sending messages, waiting for
      termination, and launching cancellable timers.
